The solution file csharp/CSC431.sln can be compiled either using Visual Studio
2010 on a lab computer or using the xbuild command from Mono
(http://www.mono-project.com/).  You will need Mono 2.8 or higher.

The compiler exe should be placed at csharp/CSC431/bin/Debug/CSC431.exe.  It can
be run with this command:
  mono --runtime=v4.0.30319 CSC431.exe
The lower caseness of the v is important. 

By default it will read a program from standard in.  You can also provide a file
name as an argument.  Add --help  to see a list of command line arguments.

Compiling with LLVM will only work on Windows and the generated LLVM bitcode
only translates correctly on x86 or x64.
